# Flatiron Rails Project - Meals For Me

The Meals For Me project is an app that allows users to sign up as eaters or cooks.  The cooks will create foods that they are willing to cook and will enter a brief description of the food.  The eaters can pick any of these foods and create a meal (future feature is to be able to schedule meals).  Once the meal is created, the eater and the cook can comment on the meal.  Meals For Me connects cooks and eaters.
